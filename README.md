Kotama is the backend api serving [queries](https://github.com/Kractero/kee). The api is built with Express. The main endpoint for interacting with trade records is the base route. This endpoint takes the exact same format as the frontend takes, and will parse it to make the same query.

Named for the Communications leader of Veritas.
